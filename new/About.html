                the land area is agricultural but not full culminated due to drowned areas.

            <h1>Agriculture:</h1>
            <p>
                One of the major source of income in Barangay Dinaga is rice farming. Farmers sells their produce either
                raw "palays" or rice to traders at nearby barangay or outside the municipality.
                Aside from rice farming, some raised pigs, chicken and other livestock in their backyard to augment
                their income and few are engaging in vegetable production as additional source of income as most of
                vegetables planted are just their own consumption.

                hall since the old building in the barangay where the Day Care Center
                formerly housed was totally damaged by the typhoon reming during the occurrence last November, 2006,

                goal in life and some are working to augment the meager income of their parents to support the families.

        <div class="text1" id="history">
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p><b>Dinaga</b> is another of the five barangays that constitutes the poblacion of Canaman. It is bounded
                on the north by the canaman Creek
                and the Barangay Sta.Cruz. Its southern side is a flat stretch of rice land that reach all way to
                Barangay San Vicente and Del Rosario.
                Dinaga's Eastern part shares its boundary with Baras, San Austin and Haring, while to its west is the
                Barangay of Pangpang, the common boundary of which runs straight
                down the middle of the town's catholic church.
                <br><br>
                It may be accurately said that Dinaga is spin-off of Barangay Pangpang, and that evidently came into
                official being during Spanish times perhaps during the part of
                the 1600. Before that, the area was low, marshy place which went under water when the high tide from San
                Miguel Bay caused the water the Bicol River to back up
                and prevent the creek from emptying into it. These daily tidal floods were worsened whenever it rained.
                Thus, the poeple had no desire to live in the swampy place.
                <br><br>
                Oral history says that before the poeple moved into low laying area, they patiently dumped into the
                place in order to keep the daily tidal flood away from their new homesites.
                Obviously , the work most likely done by a combination of community hongloan and corvee labor or
                polo-strecthed overtime, with the inhabitants first building up the site
                where they had settled in, on the western portion of the present barangay, immediately beside the
                church. Later on, as more poeple settled the place which later on becaome part
                of the central settlement(<b>casco de la poblacion</b>), they dumped more earth fill on both sides of
                the trail leading towards the cementery, the parallel earthfill just wide
                enough to build house on. Thus, the raised portion of Dinaga is axe-shaped, with its western end the
                head and its eastern side the handle. It also helps explain why houses on its eastern
                portion are laid in panel pattern, as against the grid pattern in the western side as well as in
                adjacent Pangpang.
                <br><br>
                Logically too, the poeple originally refered to place as <strong>DINAGAAN</strong>(filled with earth).
                Later, usage shortened the referential name to <strong>Dinaga</strong>, and it's the name that the
                barangay carries some three centuries later, although for a while in the early 1900s, it went the name
                <b><i>"BAGONG BAYAN"</i></b>.
